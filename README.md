# odin-calculator
This project is a project undertaken as part of `The Odin Project` learning web course teaching `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript` skills. It involved putting into practice the teachings of `JavaScript` taught in the previous lessons and required the active use of research and preparation to find the correct JavaScript methods to use.

The use of JavaScript is highly introduced within this project to demonstrate my skills in DOM methods and the manipulation of `HTML` and `CSS` from `JavaScript`. The Calculator is a simple application that aims to bring the features of the working arithmetic tool to the web through the integration of `JavaScript` functions. It uses array methods, event listeners, element references, and conditional statements to assess the condition of the application. 

Important details include the processing of only two values with operators such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. Negative values can be processed and the display contains an auto overflow value meaning extreme numbers can be entered and can still be seen albeit not easily. 

## Features

- **Performs Core Arithmetic Operations** - Includes core arithmetic operations on two given values including addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. 

- **Display with Overflow Management** - Long input and extreme numbers are accomodated with the overflow value of the display set to auto so that the user can scroll through their input when it exceeds the boundary.

- **Decimals** - Allows the use of decimals as the given values and restricts the user to use only one decimal point for each value.

- **Negative numbers** - Processing of arithmetic calculations can be done with negative numbers with few errors.

- **Clear and Delete Buttons** - Clear and delete buttons allow the user to completely remove all or a single character on the display so that mistakenly entered input can be corrected without causing error in the application.

- **Keyboard Support** - Allows the use of the keyboard to provide input. Number keys enter numbers into the display as do the operators and decimal. Backspace, delete and enter all do their corresponding actions much like the buttons when pressed.
